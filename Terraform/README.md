Terraform is an Infrastrutre as Code (IaC) tool developed by Hashicorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastruture using code instead of manually provisioning resources.

Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platfroms and other servies through their Application Programming Interface(API).

That's being said, you write plain text files with the .tf extension to define what are the resoureces you need in AWS, then those resouces will be created.

There are other tools like For example, CludFormation in AWS and ResourceManager in Azure.

But why Terraform,
     You can't learn many tools, time wasting process so we need to learn one thing which is best.

     Terraform is the best tool to do an any cloud.

Let's create infrastrute in AWS using Terrafrom.
